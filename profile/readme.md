# HireBeware

### Our Mission

We realized there’s a huge problem with hiring: you never know if a candidate will work out. Maybe they aren’t as good as they say or are lazy. Maybe they smell as bad as Steve Jobs or they are some sort of AI bot, who knows?

So we set out to create the Yelp of hiring. People can leave anonymous reviews of their experiences working with someone for job creators to view — saving them time, money, and frustration.
